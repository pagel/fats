Its notation above exists for informational purposes only.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Configuration\r\nThe setup process includes cloning the repository, setting Apache configuration options for the site, creating directories in specific locations, and setting application options.\r\n\r\n### Clone the Repository\r\nIn the Apache document root, clone the FATS repository.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:pagel/fats.git fats\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Apache Configuration\r\nFor the application's web services to work properly, you must activate the FileInfo override for the site.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Directory \"/path/to/fats\">\r\n     AllowOverride FileInfo\r\n     Order allow,deny\r\n     Allow from all\r\n</Directory>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Required Directories\r\nThe FATS web application is configured to store file uploads outside of the web root and downloads in the web root.  These paths appear in src/DAL/DataAccessLayer.php and must be updated as appropriate to avoid issues with upload and download functionality.\r\n\r\nThe directories that store file uploads and downloads must be accessible to the process running httpd.  Alternatively, you can set permissions such that any user can read and write to these directories.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ chmod 777 /path/to/uploadordownload/directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Application Options\r\nThe FATS web application stores certain pieces of information in an XML file for easy retrieval, including configuration options and database credentials.  This file resides in /src/application.xml.  If you choose to move or rename this file, you must update its location in /src/BLL/Application.php and /src/Helpers/ApplicationHelper.php to avoid error conditions.\r\n","tagline":"McCormick Faculty Advancement Tracking System","google":""}
